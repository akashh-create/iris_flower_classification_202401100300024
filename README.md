Iris Flower Classification


The Iris Flower Classification is a supervised machine learning problem that involves classifying iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Using the famous Iris dataset, which contains sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, a model is trained to accurately predict the flower species. Popular algorithms used for this classification include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, and k-NN. This dataset is widely used for benchmarking classification models and understanding fundamental machine learning concepts.
